# Neural-Network-Implementation-for-MNIST
Implemented neural networks to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using Python (version 3.10).

 Neural Network Library: Developed a custom neural network library (NeuralNetwork_Lib.py) to facilitate the training and evaluation of neural network models.

MNIST Model:
        Developed a neural network for digit classification using the MNIST dataset (fit_MNIST.py).
        The training process may take a few minutes due to the complexity of the dataset.
        Generated and saved graphs and model weights for further analysis.
